## Description

This is the front end and client side for this run-tracker application. It
provides a simple and user friendly interface that allows the user to log,
organize, and manage their runs. It uses an event handler -> API -> UI structure
to take in user information, make API requests, and display that information
for the user.

## Technologies Used

Bootstrap, Heroku, Chart.js

## Unsolved Problems

There are various UI challenges that would be great to address to make this app
more user-standard-ready, including: a way to organize many runs so they aren't
all displayed; recognizable features like a standard settings UI; an instruction
or help section for user guidance.

## Development Process

I started by first looking to make pieces functional bit by bit. I wanted
the key items to be on the screen and have them successfully interact with the
API. Once those connections were working, I started to work on formatting.
Looking back, I would have incorporated formatting into the work more
progressively as I went along.
